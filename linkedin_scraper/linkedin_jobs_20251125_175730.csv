Job Description

English Language Experts

Are you excited about writing, research, and language — and eager to apply your skills to the future of AI?

This is a fully remote, fully flexible role where you decide your schedule. Not only will you be able to implement your writing and language skills in impactful projects, but you’ll also have the opportunity to build passive income forever through our referral program, earning as long as your referred candidates continue working.

📌 To ensure the success of your application, we strongly recommend watching our video guide on the application process before applying.

The Role: Where Your Language Expertise Meets AI Innovation

As an AI Data Trainer, you will:

Develop AI Training Content: Create detailed prompts in various topics and responses to guide AI learning, ensuring the models reflect a comprehensive understanding of diverse subjects.
Optimize AI Performance: Evaluate and rank AI responses to enhance the model's accuracy, fluency, and contextual relevance.
Ensure Model Integrity: Test AI models for potential inaccuracies or biases, validating their reliability across use cases.

Bring your expertise - we’ll take care of the rest with a tailored onboarding experience that sets you up for success from day one.

Your Profile

Apply if this sounds like you (even if not every point applies):

You are a student or graduate with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Linguistics, Communication, or a related field.
You have a strong command of written English, with good grammar, syntax, and stylistic versatility.
You enjoy doing research, exploring new topics, and turning ideas into clear, structured content.
You like creative writing, experimenting with different tones and formats.
You bring an analytical mindset and pay attention to detail, delivering quality work independently.
You might even have experience with AI/LLM training — if so, that’s a great plus, but it’s not required.

Commitment

This is a fully flexible, remote role - you choose when and where you work. To set yourself up for success on the project, it makes sense to dedicate at least 20 hours per week or more, while still keeping a healthy balance that fits your lifestyle.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4320232884/
