Job Description

English Language Experts

Are you excited about writing, research, and language — and eager to apply your skills to the future of AI?

This is a fully remote, fully flexible role where you decide your schedule. Not only will you be able to implement your writing and language skills in impactful projects, but you’ll also have the opportunity to build passive income forever through our referral program, earning as long as your referred candidates continue working.

📌 To ensure the success of your application, we strongly recommend watching our video guide on the application process before applying.

The Role: Where Your Language Expertise Meets AI Innovation

As an AI Data Trainer, you will:

Develop AI Training Content: Create detailed prompts in various topics and responses to guide AI learning, ensuring the models reflect a comprehensive understanding of diverse subjects.
Optimize AI Performance: Evaluate and rank AI responses to enhance the model's accuracy, fluency, and contextual relevance.
Ensure Model Integrity: Test AI models for potential inaccuracies or biases, validating their reliability across use cases.

Bring your expertise - we’ll take care of the rest with a tailored onboarding experience that sets you up for success from day one.

Your Profile

You are a student or graduate with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Linguistics, Communication, or a related field.
You have a strong command of written English, with good grammar, syntax, and stylistic versatility.
You enjoy doing research, exploring new topics, and turning ideas into clear, structured content.
You like creative writing, experimenting with different tones and formats.
You bring an analytical mindset and pay attention to detail, delivering quality work independently.
You might even have experience with AI/LLM training — if so, that’s a great plus, but it’s not required.

Commitment

This is a fully flexible, remote role - you choose when and where you work. To set yourself up for success on the project, it makes sense to dedicate at least 20 hours per week or more, while still keeping a healthy balance that fits your lifestyle.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4320232884/

Job Title: eIDAS Auditor (Freelance)

Job Type: Freelance/Contractor

Salary: Negotiable rates dependant on experience

Are you looking for the opportunity to advance your career within eIDAS regulations by becoming an auditor?

BSI is a conformity assessment body for the UK and EU eIDAS Regulation and provides certification that is recognized across the European Union by trust service providers and regulatory authorities. This BSI conformity assessment ensures that digital trust services meet the required standards of security, reliability, and compliance. It is designed to support Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs) in delivering trusted services such as electronic signatures, seals, timestamps, and website authentication, fostering confidence in the digital ecosystem.

As a BSI eIDAS auditor you will join our team of experienced professionals.

You'll have solid working knowledge and experience in Trust Services Providers, including a good understanding of eIDAS, Trust Services and the relevant ETSI standards. Previous experience with auditing management system standards such as ISO 27001 is desirable but not essential.

You’ll be home-based, but you'll be out and about visiting our clients daily (so you need to be comfortable with daily travel and will need to hold a full driving licence). You’ll usually spend nine out of ten days auditing. You'll need to be comfortable with interacting and speaking to different people in all capacities.

To ensure you have a good work/life balance, we like to minimise the travel requirements on our Auditors wherever possible, which may also include some remote auditing. That means for this role, we’re looking for someone located in either the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France or Germany.

Key Responsibilities

As an eIDAS Auditor, your role will include:

Conducting compliance audits for Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs) under the eIDAS Regulation.
Evaluating systems, policies, and processes for adherence to standards such as ETSI EN 319 401, 319 411-1/-2, EN 319 421 and other relevant specifications.
Producing and reviewing detailed audit reports with actionable recommendations.
Staying updated on legislative changes and technical standards within the trust services domain.
Collaborating with cross-functional teams to address complex compliance challenges.


Required Skills & Experience

Proven experience in digital trust services or information security.
In-depth knowledge of eIDAS Regulation and related ETSI standards.
Certifications such as CISA, ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Auditor, or equivalent (preferred).
Strong understanding of cryptographic principles and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
Excellent analytical skills and attention to detail.
Effective communication and report-writing skills.
Ability to work independently and manage multiple projects.
