Job Description

English Language Experts

Are you excited about writing, research, and language — and eager to apply your skills to the future of AI?

This is a fully remote, fully flexible role where you decide your schedule. Not only will you be able to implement your writing and language skills in impactful projects, but you’ll also have the opportunity to build passive income forever through our referral program, earning as long as your referred candidates continue working.

📌 To ensure the success of your application, we strongly recommend watching our video guide on the application process before applying.

The Role: Where Your Language Expertise Meets AI Innovation

As an AI Data Trainer, you will:

Develop AI Training Content: Create detailed prompts in various topics and responses to guide AI learning, ensuring the models reflect a comprehensive understanding of diverse subjects.
Optimize AI Performance: Evaluate and rank AI responses to enhance the model's accuracy, fluency, and contextual relevance.
Ensure Model Integrity: Test AI models for potential inaccuracies or biases, validating their reliability across use cases.

Bring your expertise - we’ll take care of the rest with a tailored onboarding experience that sets you up for success from day one.

Your Profile

Apply if this sounds like you (even if not every point applies):

You are a student or graduate with a Bachelor’s or Master’s degree in Linguistics, Communication, or a related field.
You have a strong command of written English, with good grammar, syntax, and stylistic versatility.
You enjoy doing research, exploring new topics, and turning ideas into clear, structured content.
You like creative writing, experimenting with different tones and formats.
You bring an analytical mindset and pay attention to detail, delivering quality work independently.
You might even have experience with AI/LLM training — if so, that’s a great plus, but it’s not required.

Commitment

This is a fully flexible, remote role - you choose when and where you work. To set yourself up for success on the project, it makes sense to dedicate at least 20 hours per week or more, while still keeping a healthy balance that fits your lifestyle.",https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/4320232884/

As a BSI eIDAS auditor you will join our team of experienced professionals.

You'll have solid working knowledge and experience in Trust Services Providers, including a good understanding of eIDAS, Trust Services and the relevant ETSI standards. Previous experience with auditing management system standards such as ISO 27001 is desirable but not essential.

You’ll be home-based, but you'll be out and about visiting our clients daily (so you need to be comfortable with daily travel and will need to hold a full driving licence). You’ll usually spend nine out of ten days auditing. You'll need to be comfortable with interacting and speaking to different people in all capacities.

To ensure you have a good work/life balance, we like to minimise the travel requirements on our Auditors wherever possible, which may also include some remote auditing. That means for this role, we’re looking for someone located in either the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, France or Germany.

Key Responsibilities

As an eIDAS Auditor, your role will include:

Conducting compliance audits for Qualified Trust Service Providers (QTSPs) under the eIDAS Regulation.
Evaluating systems, policies, and processes for adherence to standards such as ETSI EN 319 401, 319 411-1/-2, EN 319 421 and other relevant specifications.
Producing and reviewing detailed audit reports with actionable recommendations.
Staying updated on legislative changes and technical standards within the trust services domain.
Collaborating with cross-functional teams to address complex compliance challenges.


Required Skills & Experience

Proven experience in digital trust services or information security.
In-depth knowledge of eIDAS Regulation and related ETSI standards.
Certifications such as CISA, ISO/IEC 27001 Lead Auditor, or equivalent (preferred).
Strong understanding of cryptographic principles and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).
Excellent analytical skills and attention to detail.
Effective communication and report-writing skills.
Ability to work independently and manage multiple projects.

Our ambition is to set a standard of excellence in the industry for technical documentation and documentation practice. This is your chance to be a part of that, as a Technical Author at Canonical.

We are building documentation capacity at scale. We have dozens of positions available, for teams and products across the organisation, at all levels from Graduate to Senior Staff.

All applications and candidates are handled through this one entry-point.

To improve your chances of success in this application, read our advice on how to get a job at Canonical.

These are not traditional technical writer roles. As a Technical Author, you will lead the documentation efforts of a Canonical team, in engineering, business operations or another part of the company.

You will combine excellence in technical communication with subject-matter expertise and the ability to collaborate with colleagues across the organisation. Even the most junior Technical Authors will have the opportunity to develop and demonstrate technical authority, contributing to documentation practice as a first-class engineering and business discipline.

You will work with the Diátaxis approach to documentation and help elevate standards of technical writing through attention to theory and practice.

The role of a Technical Author

A product-focused Technical Author is a member of a product engineering team, typically focused on a product or family of products. In this role you'll help the team develop documentation that serves the needs of the product's users. You will have responsibility for the quality of the user experience with the product, and will contribute towards the long-term success of the project itself.

A customer-focused Technical Author works in a team such as Field Engineering, Customer Success or Support, dealing with users of complex suites of Canonical software products, sometimes deployed in custom configurations. In this role you’ll take a responsive approach to software documentation problems and develop a strong understanding of how products work together and are used in the real world.

An operations-focused Technical Author is part of a business team, for example Legal, HR or Talent. An important part of this work is to maintain internal documentation, such as employee handbooks. In this role you will help develop and improve materials that hundreds of colleagues rely on daily, and define patterns of business communication for a rapidly-growing organisation.
